## this is an example of a standalone models package
---
This package can be included to process with creating separate models in a project.

Example displays:

* Creating a real model to represent data source
* Creating a metrics wrapper in case you want to log time consuming funcs
* Creating a mock model... Just in case

(psst!) I don't recommend to run `init()` function in this example. Remember, it's just an example!
